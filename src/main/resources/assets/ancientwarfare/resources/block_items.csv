#block-items file
# lines beginning with # denote comments
# format is:
#block_name,block_meta,item_name,item_damage
#block_name = name
#block_meta = the meta having an item assigned to it -1 for all
#item_name = the name of the item being assigned to block/meta combo -- null for forced-no-item
#item_damage = the item damage for the item-stack for the block/meta combo
#item_qty = the number of item needed to create that block (1 for most, 2 for double-slabs)
#any block without an item assigned will use the default itemblock for item-stacks
