towns todo:

add villagers to vanilla village templates
add bandits to bandit tent templates
add villagers to extra house templates (officer house, tinker house)
create rgate and lgate of both bandit and cobblestone walls
add loot to governors house, church?, ranchhouse
scan and add realty office to templates
reduce frequency of outhouse generation (2-3 per town would be ideal), or remove gold

remove lamp-post templates from ticked-generation, create those as soon as all other structures have been done
check for intersection for of blocks for lamp-post templates

post-town-gen callback for the town-generator, for when all current templates are finished, to begin next step
(e.g. roads -after- walls, lamp post validation -after- cosmetic structures)
