towns todo:

load/save all chunk-generation and structure generation tickets, find way to load/save the callback tickets...srsly..how?
reduce frequency of outhouse generation (2-3 per town would be ideal), or remove gold
screenshots for all new structures (bandit, village, cosmetic, walls)
lamp post validation; dont' build in front of doors
increase 'building expansion' setting from 1-2 in the default town templates
update instruction manual with information on town system
squash all bugs from git that can be squashed in a reasonable amount of time and that would not require extensive testing
