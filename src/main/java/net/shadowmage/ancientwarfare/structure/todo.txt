towns todo:

add villagers to vanilla village templates
add bandits to bandit tent templates
add villagers to extra house templates (officer house, tinker house)
create rgate and lgate of both bandit and cobblestone walls
add loot to governors house, church?, ranchhouse
scan and add realty office to templates
reduce frequency of outhouse generation (2-3 per town would be ideal), or remove gold
intersection testing vs. vanilla villages is not working properly (should be testing for block-type)
