towns todo:

add bandits to bandit tent templates
add loot to governors house, church?, ranchhouse, bandit tents
fix lighting in barracks, ranch-house attic
rescan bandit, governor, ranchhouse, barracks templates after fixing
reduce frequency of outhouse generation (2-3 per town would be ideal), or remove gold
screenshots for all new structures (bandit, village, cosmetic, walls)
?? (maybe fixed, need lots of testing) fix towns generating over vanilla villages, validation -still- not working properly...

scan and add realty office to templates
scan and add any new structures from build server
