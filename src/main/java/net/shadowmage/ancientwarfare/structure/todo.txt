towns todo:

add bandits to bandit tent templates
add loot to governors house, church?, ranchhouse, bandit tents
fix lighting in barracks, ranch-house attic
rescan bandit, governor, ranchhouse, barracks templates after fixing
reduce frequency of outhouse generation (2-3 per town would be ideal), or remove gold
screenshots for all new structures (bandit, village, cosmetic, walls)
?? (maybe fixed, need lots of testing) fix towns generating over vanilla villages, validation -still- not working properly...

scan and add realty office to templates
scan and add any new structures from build server

fix issue in ticked builder regarding doors; door bit is likely being broken prior to upper block being placed, upper bock then replaces entire door
