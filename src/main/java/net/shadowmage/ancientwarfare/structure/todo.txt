towns todo:

add loot to ranchhouse
fix lighting in barracks, ranch-house attic
rescan ranchhouse, barracks templates after fixing
reduce frequency of outhouse generation (2-3 per town would be ideal), or remove gold
screenshots for all new structures (bandit, village, cosmetic, walls)
?? (maybe fixed, need lots of testing) fix towns generating over vanilla villages, validation -still- not working properly...

structure intersection testing -- do not generate structures in town bounds, do not generate
