towns todo:

area selection
* need to clean up how areas are selected, perhaps using a min/max height check for the chunk rather than average height

area validation
* need to validate an area along the borders to ensure town is not cutting into any vanilla / other mods' structures
* need to examine structure-gen map to make sure there are no structures in the area

template selection

template generation
* need to add in lamp-post generation code
* need to add in second-pass plot generation for cosmetic structures
* post generation, need to insert a 'town' structure into the structure-gen map, denoting the bounds of the town and town-cluster value
