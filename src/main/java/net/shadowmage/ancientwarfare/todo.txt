	They will no longer stop when inventory is full -- they will instead just throw things into the world	
		or perhaps just have a single overflow slot that if it is full will trigger hasWork()==false
		--would require the tile to constantly poll this slot, and dump into normal harvest inventory if
		there were a stack in it.
	
	Tree Farm:
		How to build a tree-harvesting automation block that is event driven and does
			not need to constantly re-scan its work-area, and does not lose work-ticks to
			not having work?
		Need:
			list of saplings that can be force-grown with bonemeal
			list of target planting blocks that need saplings planted
			list of target clearing blocks that are grown trees ready to remove.
			a way to validate that inventory has a sapling in it before attempting planting
