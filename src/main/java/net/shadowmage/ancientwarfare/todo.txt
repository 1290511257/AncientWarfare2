****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
		
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
* Research
	-lots-
	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
* Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice(er)
* move structure scanner over to multi-key item interface
* Textures
	construction tool
* Structure Module Plugins
	npcs?? (should be mostly handled?)
	town-hall block
	all automation-module blocks
	--need worksite work-bounds rotation/manipulation code
* Recipes
	-lots-
		
****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
^ lots of testing/validation on new warehouse system
^ finish up storage block filter-setting ability, verify that it works properly (needs the above step to view storage-block inventory contents)
* Torque API:	
	Add high-quality blocks with higher capacity and less/no power loss.
* Textures
	sterling/waterwheel/hand cranged engines (or models and uv maps)
	warehouse storage med/large
	med/heavy flywheel blocks
* create med/large warehouse storage blocks	
* Recipes
	-lots-
* balance the power system -- input/output/use/etc.  see what kind of input/etc BC stuff normally uses as a good baseline
* add redstone control to flywheel blocks
			
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
^ verify that faction based mounted soldiers work as intended
^ verify functionality of mounted player-owned npcs (all)
* Default held items for priest, trader
* Sounds
	bard
* Textures
	bard
* Recipes
	-lots-
			
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
		
****************************MODEL-EDITOR MODULE TODO****************************
* UV editor GUI needs area positions re-set when GUI size changes
* when you swap a primitive parent, the old parent is still selected with the primitive (modelWidget, selection error)
* sometimes pieces are unpickable -- this is likely related to primitive #'s / piece heirarchy
