core
	crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
	research system--needs definitions of research for research tree
	block and item textures (engineering station, research station, research book, research notes)
	Chunkloader blocks

GUIS (all modules)
	need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements
	create item-slot container to improve rendering of item-slots
		might even go so far as to implement custom rendering handling
		for the actual items instead of relying on RenderItem
	Finish creating proper text-input validation stuff for Text and NumberInput widgets
	SHIFT-CLICK CODE

modeler
	who knows.... will need to start using it to find out what is broken / not working, will need it in vehicle module
	
structures module (done for now)
	plugins / support for other modules
	template plugin support for gates
	textures for drafting station, survival-mode builder block
	rework gates as a multi-block? (use controller TE TESR to render gate)
		at that point, can use blocks for collision and interaction
		probably less buggy than the entity-based interaction
		but how to handle only partially loaded gates?

automation module:
	GUIs Needed:
		
	Target select GUI is non-functional, and/or cannot remove targets			
	API / compat stuff:
		add IMC-based API to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??
		add config-based method to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??	
	warehouse needs to eject/limit item access when currentMaxStorage<currentStorage
		how to handle partially loaded warehouses, e.g. some of its storage blocks may be in unloaded chunks?
		--perhaps have different methods for tile.invalidate() and onBlockBroken
	BC Coal-Use: 1m20s/ea = 1mj/tick*20ticks*80seconds = 1600mj / ea
	bc-energy-output worksite (hand-cranked eng. equivalent)  perhaps a flywheel block that can turn work() into MJ
		and output it via BC pipes....will require testing...
	warehouse output GUI -- swap filters from bottom to top, clone layout from storage block
				
	
npcs module
	worker will have 'work sites' list / work-order item, denoting which sites to work in what order/priority
		--possibility to use a user set priority list for workers
		--possibility to use a user set timetable for workers
		--possibility to use a user set route for workers
	npc types
		researcher (research)
		craftsman (builder)
		farmer (farms / animal farms)
		lumberjack (tree farms / builder)
		miner (quarries / builder)
		courier (item routing)
	TODO -- everything	
		
vehicles module
	everything


BLOCK ROTATION HANDLING
	Need meta-based rotation system for blocks.  
		Two systems actually, one for four-way blocks (nsew), one for six-way blocks (udnsew)
	Also need block-icon lookup.	
		--need to map relativeSide->IIcon
		--need to lookup relativeSide from blockMeta & mcSide
	Also need inventory-side-accessed lookup
		--need to know what inventorySide is accessed from which mcSide
		--need to know what mcSide accesses a given inventorySide
