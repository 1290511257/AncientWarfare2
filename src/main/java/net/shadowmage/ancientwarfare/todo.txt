core (done for now)
	crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
	research system--needs definitions of research for research tree
	block and item textures (engineering station, research station, research book, research notes)

GUIS (all modules)
	need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements

modeler
	who knows.... will need to start using it to find out what is broken / not working, will need it in vehicle module
	
structures module (done for now)
	plugins / support for other modules
	textures for drafting station, survival-mode builder
	rework gates as a multi-block? (use controller TE TESR to render gate)
		at that point, can use blocks for collision and interaction
		probably less buggy than the entity-based interaction
		but how to handle only partially loaded gates?

automation module:
	API / compat stuff:
		add IMC-based API to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??
		add config-based method to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??	
		add plugin / support for power systems (mechanical worker block)(need APIs updated first)
	mechanical hopper block -- configurable pull / push side (s), and on/off push control
		with filter list per-side -- needs redstone power to function?
	optional input slot to run mechanical worker directly with coal -- disabled by default in config?	
	waterwheel type engine / waterwheel worker
	hand-cranked engine/dynamo/whatever to interface workers with other power systems
	warehouse needs to eject/limit item access when currentMaxStorage<currentStorage
		how to handle partially loaded warehouses, e.g. some of its storage blocks may be in unloaded chunks?
		--perhaps have different methods for tile.invalidate() and onBlockBroken

npcs module
	worker will have 'work sites' list / work-order item, denoting which sites to work in what order or priority	
	everything	
		
vehicles module
	everything


	
	
	
Warehouse Functioning:
	Control Block
		Coordinates moving things between storage, input, output blocks.
		All actual items are stored in the controller block, storage blocks only add more room.
		
	Storage Blocks
		Don't actually have any inventory -- inventory is managed in controller
		Only used to add storage space to the warehouse (as per old-versions)
		CAN BE SET to display the quantity of specific warehouse goods via filter
			(configurable via GUI)???
		
	Input Blocks
		Items stored in slots, minimal number of slots per block
		items set by filter and automatically refilled by warehouse controller (use couriers to route to final destination)
		warehouse withdraws all potential items from input blocks to store in storage
		
	Output Blocks
		Items stored in slots, minimal number of slots per block (perhaps 3/6 per 'side', each side configurable independently)
		Controller	

Warehouse Control:
	Maintain list of storage, input, output tiles.
	Maintain list of tiles to update (those that have had their inventory marked dirty)
	Calculate transfers from input to storage, storage to output
	Calculate repack transfers from storage to storage
