****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
	
****************************TEXTURES TODO****************************
TEXTURES
	core
	automation
		warehouse storage medium 
		warehouse storage large
		hand-cranked-generator
		sterling generator
		waterwheel generator	
	npc
		recruiting station
	vehicle	
	
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
^ (fixed) research table has some bug where it will stall out even with proper resources, perhaps a resource-meta-matching problem, or some issue with checking power levels
* crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* Finish creating proper text-input validation stuff for Text and NumberInput widgets
	need support for space, underscore, period.
	need to setup validation per-input box...
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
> plugins / support for vehicle module
> plugin support for automation module	
* plugin support for npc module
	npcs--done?
	blocks--
		town hall
		recruiting station
		structure-control block	
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
* Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice
* screenshots for all default-included structures
* add lake-filling item
	needs basic pathfinding algorithm to find what blocks to fill
* basic construction/destruction tools -- set block in an area, clear blocks in an area (possibly same tool)	

****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
^ lots of testing/validation on new warehouse system
* Torque API:
	Add input max/tick code to tiles, reset counter every tile-update.
	Add power-loss to blocks.  The amount lost should be proportional to the amount stored.  Something about
		drag from air resistance increasing with the speed of the object that is moving. Allow for higher-grade blocks to not lose power.			
	Add high-quality blocks with higher capacity and less/no power loss.
* recipes for nearly everything
* finish up storage block filter-setting ability, verify that it works properly (needs the above step to view storage-block inventory contents)
* add a 'warehouse stock viewer panel' --sign that can be slapped on the side of storage/input/output blocks to view the stock level of specified items (items specified via gui)
		
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
* add npc-recruiting station -- worksite, crafting
	has input slots for raw recruiting goods -- possibly just have input of player-owned raw npc-recruiting items to spawn/equip directly
	has X queue slots for queuing npcs for recruiting
	has X weapon/armor slots corresponding to queue slots
	when work is completed, spawns an NPC equipped with the items from the corresponding queue spots
	each input slot type has a different block-side to allow for automated item input
	allow for auto-queue of npc type
	-use is optional, players can always craft the raw npc items and equip manually
* method for creative-mode players to access and alter faction-based NPCs -- equipment, owner-name??, other settings?
	add a temp disable wander control -- non saved, used for map setup
	allow them to follow creative players for positioning
	-- add 'creative controls' button to normal NPC inventory (most stuff could be applicable to player-owned npcs as well)
		this button is only available when viewer is in creative mode, and allows access to advanced controls.
* find default sound/music for bards
* alter bard sound lookup to allow for user-specified string
	needs testing to verify that users can add their own sounds.json file in resource packs in addition to the mod-shipped one
* rework player owned trader gui to still allow access to inventory. (just add an 'inventory' button to gui?)
* rework faction owned GUI to allow for creative-mode access to inventory (just add a 'inventory' button to gui when player is in creative mode?)
* add item for priest holy-symbols (should I just make it a 'religious book'?)
* faction owned archer default ranged attack	
* add recipes and research requirements for npcs/items/blocks
* add recipes to copy upkeep/work/combat/routing orders		
* move custom tex ref and owner name into data-watcher for ease of synching--would not need entity packet handler for npcs at that point

	
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
		
****************************MEIM MODULE TODO****************************
> who knows.... will need to start using it to find out what is broken / not working, will need it in vehicle module
