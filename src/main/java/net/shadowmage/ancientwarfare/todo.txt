****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
		
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
* Recipes
	-lots-
	-create generic 'component' item -- merely a subtyped item for functionless components
* Research
	-lots-
* Textures
	Steel Ingot
	Component Item
		* wood, iron, steel gear
		* wood, iron, steel bushing
		* wood, iron, steel shafts	
	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
> add 'ambient sounds' block -- plays from input sounds either on selectable trigger or configurable/random frequency
> Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice(er)
> move structure scanner over to multi-key item interface
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
* Structure Module Plugins
	npcs?? (should be mostly handled?)
	town-hall block
	all automation-module blocks
	--need worksite work-bounds rotation/manipulation code	
		
****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
^ lots of testing/validation on new warehouse system
^ finish up storage block filter-setting ability, verify that it works properly (needs the above step to view storage-block inventory contents)
* Torque API:	
	set power capacity / power loss / power use for all torque blocks
* Textures
	waterwheel/hand cranged engines (or models and uv maps)
* balance the power system -- input/output/use/etc.  see what kind of input/etc BC stuff normally uses as a good baseline
* add redstone control to flywheel blocks
* figure out torque tile network updates
	--how to make them appear active when there is energy traveling through even when they end at 0 energy?
		rotation = energy stored + energy outputted?
			
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
^ verify that faction based mounted soldiers work as intended
^ verify functionality of mounted player-owned npcs (all)
* Default held items for priest, trader
* fix sounds.json for bard sounds
* test bard-sound loading and custom sound references
* add a 'known-sounds' selection list to bard gui to pick from known mc sounds
* Sounds
	bard
* Textures
	bard
* Recipes
	-lots-
			
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
		
****************************MODEL-EDITOR MODULE TODO****************************
* UV editor GUI needs area positions re-set when GUI size changes
* when you swap a primitive parent, the old parent is still selected with the primitive (modelWidget, selection error)
* sometimes pieces are unpickable -- this is likely related to primitive #'s / piece heirarchy
