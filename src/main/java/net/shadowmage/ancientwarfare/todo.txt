Torque Cleanup
	* texture for windmill blade default block
	* distributor needs separate output speeds per-output head
	* edit instructions regarding submitting bug reports/issues to not mention flagging for certain things	
	* adjust waterwheel so one of its sides may be 'in' water blocks (for water flowing down onto the wheel)
	* animal farm animal gui not synching initial server values to client on gui open
	* tree farm will pickup fences, whatever wood blocks are in the area, not just logs... check for initial block extends block-log on block-find query
	* tree farm still has efficiency issues as soon as it gets full -- kills server TPS
	* fix gap in windmill model (and probably redo texture)
	* torque conduits/etc can have mobs spawn on top/need lighting
	* torque conduits trigger connection with fences/stone walls/etc
	* add donators to credits in instruction manual	
	* update instruction manual with information regarding new torque system
	* update instruction manual with information regarding updated traders (screenshots, etc)
