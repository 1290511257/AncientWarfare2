Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs

****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
? Implement tile-based rotatable block -- twenty-four way
* crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
* research system--needs definitions of research for research tree
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* Finish creating proper text-input validation stuff for Text and NumberInput widgets
	need support for space, underscore, period.
	need to setup validation per-input box...
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
* GUI - rendering of item stack quantities >99 -- need to do custom rendering of text, scaled down appropriately

****************************MEIM MODULE TODO****************************
> who knows.... will need to start using it to find out what is broken / not working, will need it in vehicle module
	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
> plugins / support for vehicle module
> plugin support for automation module		
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.	
* recipes: drafting station
* Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice
* plugin support for npc module
	npcs--done
	blocks--
		structure-control block
* textures for drafting station, survival-mode builder block
* screenshots for all default-included structures

****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
* textures for warehouse storage / input / output
* Change over worksite BB render to a TESR -- should be slightly more optimized than looping through all TEs every render tick
* Torque API:
	Add input max/tick code to tiles, reset counter every tile-update.
	Add power-loss to blocks.  The amount lost should be proportional to the amount stored.  Something about
		drag from air resistance increasing with the speed of the object that is moving. Allow for higher-grade blocks to not lose power.			
	Add high-quality blocks with higher capacity and less/no power loss.
* recipes for EVERYTHING
* warehouse output GUI -- swap filters from bottom to top, clone layout from storage block
* mailbox side-select GUI needs cleaned up to mirror worksite side-select GUI
** warehouse needs to eject/limit item access when currentMaxStorage<currentStorage
	how to handle partially loaded warehouses, e.g. some of its storage blocks may be in unloaded chunks?
	--perhaps have different methods for tile.invalidate() and onBlockBroken
	--or move back to storing actual items in the storage blocks 
		control block merely aggregates all items in storage blocks					

		
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
* find default sound/music for bards
* rework trader / gui to still allow access to inventory for player-owned traders.
* add item for bard instrument
* add item for priest holy-symbols (should I just make it a 'religious book'?)
* textures for -lots- of npc types
* spawner icons for trader, bard, priest
* add recipes and research requirements for npcs and npc-related blocks
* add recipes to copy upkeep/work/combat/routing orders		
* add npc-recruiting station -- worksite, crafting
	has input slots for raw recruiting goods -- possibly just have input of player-owned raw npc-recruiting items to spawn/equip directly
	has X queue slots for queuing npcs for recruiting
	has X weapon/armor slots corresponding to queue slots
	when work is completed, spawns an NPC equipped with the items from the corresponding queue spots
	each input slot type has a different block-side to allow for automated item input
	allow for auto-queue of npc type
	-use is optional, players can always craft the raw npc items and equip manually
	
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
