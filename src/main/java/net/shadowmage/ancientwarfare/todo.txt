core (done for now)
	crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
	research system--needs definitions of research for research tree
	block and item textures (engineering station, research station, research book, research notes)

GUIS
	need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements

modeler
	who knows....
	
structures module (done for now)
	plugins / support for other modules
	textures for drafting station, survival-mode builder

automation module:
	API / compat stuff:
		add IMC-based API to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??
		add config-based method to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??	
		add plugin / support for power systems (mechanical worker block)(need APIs updated first)
	mechanical hopper block -- configurable pull / push side (s), and on/off push control
		with filter list per-side -- needs redstone power to function?
	optional input slot to run mechanical worker directly with coal -- disabled by default in config?	
	warehouse crafting station -- crafting station that auto-pulls items from warehouse, must be placed on top of warehouse control block
		or, make it a part of the warehouse functioning?
	waterwheel type engine / waterwheel worker
	hand-cranked engine/dynamo/whatever to interface workers with other power systems
		
vehicles module
	everything

npcs module
	worker will have 'work sites' list / work-order item, denoting which sites to work in what order or priority
	everything
	
	
	
Warehouse Functioning:
	Control Block
		Coordinates moving things between storage, input, output blocks.
		All actual items are stored in the controller block, storage blocks only add more room.
		
	Storage Blocks
		Don't actually have any inventory -- inventory is managed in controller
		Only used to add storage space to the warehouse (as per old-versions)
		CAN BE SET to display the quantity of specific warehouse goods via filter
			(configurable via GUI)???
		
	Input Blocks
		Items stored in slots, minimal number of slots per block
		items set by filter and automatically refilled by warehouse controller (use couriers to route to final destination)
		warehouse withdraws all potential items from input blocks to store in storage
		
	Output Blocks
		Items stored in slots, minimal number of slots per block (perhaps 3/6 per 'side', each side configurable independently)
		Controller	

Warehouse Control:
	Maintain list of storage, input, output tiles.
	Maintain list of tiles to update (those that have had their inventory marked dirty)
	Calculate transfers from input to storage, storage to output
	Calculate repack transfers from storage to storage
