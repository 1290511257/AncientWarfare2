****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
		
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
* Research
	-lots still needs resources-
		
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
> add 'ambient sounds' block -- plays from input sounds either on selectable trigger or configurable/random frequency
> Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice(er)
> move structure scanner over to multi-key item interface
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
					
****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
^ lots of testing/validation on new warehouse system
^ finish up storage block filter-setting ability, verify that it works properly (needs the above step to view storage-block inventory contents)
* Torque API:	
	set power capacity / power loss / power use for all torque blocks
	balance the power system -- input/output/use/etc.  see what kind of input/etc BC stuff normally uses as a good baseline
* add redstone control to flywheel blocks
* figure out torque tile network updates
	--rotation speed will be (powerOutput)/(maxOutpout) + (storedEnergy)/(maxEnergy)
		--
	--or rotation speed gains half value from power transmitted, half value from energy stored (or other ratio)
			
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
^ verify that faction based mounted soldiers work as intended
^ verify functionality of mounted player-owned npcs (all)
* Default held items for priest, trader
* fix sounds.json for bard sounds
* test bard-sound loading and custom sound references
* add a 'known-sounds' selection list to bard gui to pick from known mc sounds
* Sounds
	bard
			
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
		
****************************MODEL-EDITOR MODULE TODO****************************
* UV editor GUI needs area positions re-set when GUI size changes
* when you swap a primitive parent, the old parent is still selected with the primitive (modelWidget, selection error)
* sometimes pieces are unpickable -- this is likely related to primitive #'s / piece heirarchy
