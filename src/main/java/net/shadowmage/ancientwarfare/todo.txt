****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
	
****************************TEXTURES TODO****************************
TEXTURES
	core
	automation
		warehouse storage medium 
		warehouse storage large
		hand-cranked-generator
		sterling generator
		waterwheel generator	
	npc
		recruiting station
	vehicle	
	
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
^ (fixed) research table has some bug where it will stall out even with proper resources, perhaps a resource-meta-matching problem, or some issue with checking power levels
* crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
* finish updating key-interface items with key-index tests
* add the rest of key-interface item input handler callbacks

	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
> screenshots for all default-included structures
> plugins / support for vehicle module
> plugin support for automation module
* alter structure scanner gui name-selection char validation
	--disallow invalid file-system chars (/?.'"<>[]{}!@#$%^&*()_+)
* plugin support for npc module
	npcs--done?
	blocks--
		town hall
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
* Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice(er)
* add lake-filling item
	needs basic pathfinding algorithm to find what blocks to fill
* basic construction/destruction tools -- set block in an area, clear blocks in an area (possibly same tool)	

****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
^ lots of testing/validation on new warehouse system
^ finish up storage block filter-setting ability, verify that it works properly (needs the above step to view storage-block inventory contents)
* Torque API:
	Add input max/tick code to tiles, reset counter every tile-update.
	Add power-loss to blocks.  The amount lost should be proportional to the amount stored.  Something about
		drag from air resistance increasing with the speed of the object that is moving. Allow for higher-grade blocks to not lose power.			
	Add high-quality blocks with higher capacity and less/no power loss.
* recipes for nearly everything
* add a 'warehouse stock viewer panel' --sign that can be slapped on the side of storage/input/output blocks to view the stock level of specified items (items specified via gui)
		
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
* texture for bard		
* find default sound/music for bards
* rework player owned trader gui to still allow access to inventory. (just add an 'inventory' button to gui?)
* add item for priest holy-symbols (should I just make it a 'religious book'?)
* faction owned archer default ranged attack	
* add recipes and research requirements for npcs/items/blocks
* add recipes to copy upkeep/work/combat/routing orders
* move command baton over to new advanced key-interface setup
	
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
		
****************************MEIM MODULE TODO****************************
> who knows.... will need to start using it to find out what is broken / not working, will need it in vehicle module
