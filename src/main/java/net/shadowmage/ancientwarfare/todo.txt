****************************ITEM TOOLTIPS TODO****************************
Structure Builder
	
****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
		
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
* Research
	-lots still needs resources-
* on research book, add toggle to swap between 'recipe' mode -- view research deps by recipe crafted
* sort research book research goals
* add translations for client-side options in options GUI
		
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
> add 'ambient sounds' block -- plays from input sounds either on selectable trigger or configurable/random frequency
> Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice(er)
> move structure scanner over to multi-key item interface
^ test structure-module plugins for civics, torque tiles, pretty much everything
* add survival-mode resource/recipes for all applicable plugins
* ensure that 'mod default' plugin can actually scan/place most mod-added blocks
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
* validate weighted-selection algorithm in structure template selection--seems a bit off
* structure selection 'done' button non-functional in structure-builder selection gui??
* investigate moving towards fully-qualified block and item names -- e.g. 'minecraft:stone' instead of 'stone'
					
****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
^ lots of testing/validation on new warehouse system
^ finish up storage block filter-setting ability, verify that it works properly
* Torque API:	
	set power capacity / power loss / power use for all torque blocks
	balance the power system -- input/output/use/etc.  see what kind of input/etc BC stuff normally uses as a good baseline
* add redstone control to flywheel blocks
* figure out torque tile network updates
	--rotation speed will be (powerOutput)/(maxOutpout) + (storedEnergy)/(maxEnergy)
		--
	--or rotation speed gains half value from power transmitted, half value from energy stored (or other ratio)
			
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
^ verify functionality of mounted player-owned npcs (all)
* Default held items for priest, trader, or at least some use for their item slot ?
* fix sounds.json for bard sounds
* test bard-sound loading and custom sound references
* add a 'known-sounds' selection list to bard gui to pick from known mc sounds
* the bottom bit of the npc-hat texture is reversed (damn skin-edit being backwards)	
* trader inventory button not translated (only show on faction trader if player is creative mode, only show on player owned if owner/team)
* send packet to server on npc 'picked' to merge a spawner stack into player inventory
* add armor value when shield is equipped and armor-override not set
* add bonus damage when dual-wielding weapons
 	-- how/where to calculate?
 	-- probably easiest to just check if the item has an attack-dmg modifier, rather than checking classes/subclasses/etc.
* right-click on shield-slot repeatedly will disappear items, possibly other armor slots as well
	-- make a fake intermediate inventory container, and only write out to npc once at container close 
	
			
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
		
****************************MODEL-EDITOR MODULE TODO****************************
* UV editor GUI needs area positions re-set when GUI size changes (gui-init)
* when you swap a primitive parent, the old parent is still selected with the primitive (modelWidget, selection error)
* sometimes pieces are unpickable -- this is likely related to primitive #'s / piece heirarchy
