****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
		
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
* Research
	-lots still needs resources-
* add translations for client-side options in options GUI
* adjust tooltip positioning -- it is A: under mouse, B: going offscreen to the right
	place it below the mouse
	if it would go offscreen to the right, adjust to the left -just- enough to not go offscreen
	--if tooltip is too wide...erm..fix the width of it
* clean up inconsistencies in research-book GUI between modes -- spacing / layout	
		
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
> investigate moving towards fully-qualified block and item names -- e.g. 'minecraft:stone' instead of 'stone'
> add 'ambient sounds' block -- plays from input sounds either on selectable trigger or configurable/random frequency
> Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice(er)
> move structure scanner over to multi-key item interface
^ test structure-module plugins for civics, torque tiles, pretty much everything
* add survival-mode resource/recipes for all applicable plugins
* ensure that 'mod default' plugin can actually scan/place most mod-added blocks
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
* validate weighted-selection algorithm in structure template selection--seems a bit off
* structure selection 'done' button non-functional in structure-builder selection gui??
* clean up survival mode structure building -- validate area is clear before placing block
* lighting on gate entities
					
****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
^ lots of testing/validation on new warehouse system
^ finish up storage block filter-setting ability, verify that it works properly
* Torque API:	
	set power capacity / power loss / power use for all torque blocks
	balance the power system -- input/output/use/etc.  see what kind of input/etc BC stuff normally uses as a good baseline
	performance / caching 
* figure out torque tile network updates
	--rotation speed will be (powerOutput)/(maxOutpout) + (storedEnergy)/(maxEnergy)
		--
	--or rotation speed gains half value from power transmitted, half value from energy stored (or other ratio)
* balancing of flywheels amongst multiple sized flywheel blocks	
			
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
^ verify functionality of mounted player-owned npcs (all)
^ check that the bonus damage from dual-wielding is applied correctly
^ check that bonus armor for equipping shield in offhand slot is applied correctly
* fix sounds.json for bard sounds
* test bard-sound loading and custom sound references
* add a 'known-sounds' selection list to bard gui to pick from known mc sounds
* the bottom bit of the npc-hat texture is reversed (damn skin-edit being backwards)	
* add custom level-setting ability to npc creative controls GUI -- allow setting of base level type and any applicable sub-types for that NPC
* recipes for shields
* more shield types -- because apparently people want them
	-- figure out way to have multiple styles of shields
	-- use nbt?  how to allow for nbt-shields on npc default-equipment assignment?
* randomize horse type/color/etc for faction-based NPCs
		
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
		
****************************MODEL-EDITOR MODULE TODO****************************
* UV editor GUI needs area positions re-set when GUI size changes (gui-init)
* when you swap a primitive parent, the old parent is still selected with the primitive (modelWidget, selection error)
* sometimes pieces are unpickable -- this is likely related to primitive #'s / piece heirarchy
