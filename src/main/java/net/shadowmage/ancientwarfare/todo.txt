colors for textures:
wood: d5bf82
iron: e3e6e6 (180/5/60 recolor from wood)
steel: d7e4e4 (180/20/50 recolor from wood)
gearhead: 535353

Worksite Cleanup
-split worksite stuff into a few more interfaces? might require more instanceof checks, but is -cleaner- code :: is clean code worth a performance hit (most sources say yes...and i agree...)
	-iworksite
	-iboundedtile
	-iupgradeableworksite
	-iuserconfigurableboundedtile
	
Torque Blocks
	* Industrial sterling generator multiblock
	* windmill control block	
	* windmill blade block
	
Torque Models	
	* Hand Cranked Generator
	* waterwheel generator
	* windmill blades, 3x3, 5x5
	* windmill controller
	* industrial sterling generator?

Torque Textures
	* flywheel small (3 grades)
	* flywheel large (3 grades)
	* flywheel controller (3 grades)
	* torque shaft (3 grades)
	* flywheel storage default texture (3 grades)

Torque Cleanup
-rendering of all TESRd torque blocks as items
-rendering of flywheel storage prior to multiblock being created
-rework how client-energy is updated
	-use a running average over the last X ticks (where X is network update frequency)
	-keep a tally of input, output, stored, and drain for the the duration
	-on synch, send that average if it is different than what client supposedly has
-change flywheel slightly
	-it needs to know input, output, and stored energy on client-side
	-basic flywheel, non-stackable.
	-basic industrial flywheel, stackable.  requires control block on top or bottom of stack
	-adv industrial flywheel, actual multiblock 3x3xX, control block on center/top 

??	
-split torque interface up into a ITorqueProvider class with getTorqueData(ForgeDirection side) method
	-has canInput()
	-has canOutput()
	-torque data can be per-block side
	-will allow for much cleaner multi-sided energy interactions, by allowing full input into each block side, and full output from each block side
