****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
	
****************************TEXTURES TODO****************************
TEXTURES
	core
	automation
		warehouse storage medium 
		warehouse storage large
		hand-cranked-generator
		sterling generator
		waterwheel generator	
	npc
		recruiting station
	vehicle	
	
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
* crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* Finish creating proper text-input validation stuff for Text and NumberInput widgets
	need support for space, underscore, period.
	need to setup validation per-input box...
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
* GUI - rendering of item stack quantities >99 -- need to do custom rendering of text, scaled down appropriately
* research table has some bug where it will stall out even with proper resources, perhaps a resource-meta-matching problem, or some issue with checking power levels
	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
> plugins / support for vehicle module
> plugin support for automation module	
* plugin support for npc module
	npcs--done
	blocks--
		structure-control block	
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
* Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice
* screenshots for all default-included structures
* add lake-filling item
	needs basic pathfinding algorithm to find what blocks to fill

****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
* textures for warehouse storage / input / output
* figure out lighting / color stuff on tesr renderer
* Torque API:
	Add input max/tick code to tiles, reset counter every tile-update.
	Add power-loss to blocks.  The amount lost should be proportional to the amount stored.  Something about
		drag from air resistance increasing with the speed of the object that is moving. Allow for higher-grade blocks to not lose power.			
	Add high-quality blocks with higher capacity and less/no power loss.
* recipes for nearly everything
* warehouse output GUI -- swap filters from bottom to top, clone layout from storage block
* mailbox side-select GUI needs cleaned up to mirror worksite side-select GUI
** warehouse needs to eject/limit item access when currentMaxStorage<currentStorage
	how to handle partially loaded warehouses, e.g. some of its storage blocks may be in unloaded chunks?
	--perhaps have different methods for tile.invalidate() and onBlockBroken
	--or move back to storing actual items in the storage blocks 
		control block merely aggregates all items in storage blocks	
		
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
* method for creative-mode players to access and alter faction-based NPCs -- equipment, owner-name??, other settings?
	add a temp disable wander control -- non saved, used for map setup
	allow them to follow creative players for positioning
* find default sound/music for bards
* rework trader / gui to still allow access to inventory for player-owned traders.
* add item for priest holy-symbols (should I just make it a 'religious book'?)
* textures for npc types:
	player owned trader
	player owned priest
	player owned soldier
	player owned commander
	player owned medic
	player owned archer
* faction owned archer default ranged attack	
* add recipes and research requirements for npcs and npc-related blocks
* add recipes to copy upkeep/work/combat/routing orders		
* add npc-recruiting station -- worksite, crafting
	has input slots for raw recruiting goods -- possibly just have input of player-owned raw npc-recruiting items to spawn/equip directly
	has X queue slots for queuing npcs for recruiting
	has X weapon/armor slots corresponding to queue slots
	when work is completed, spawns an NPC equipped with the items from the corresponding queue spots
	each input slot type has a different block-side to allow for automated item input
	allow for auto-queue of npc type
	-use is optional, players can always craft the raw npc items and equip manually
	
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
		
****************************MEIM MODULE TODO****************************
> who knows.... will need to start using it to find out what is broken / not working, will need it in vehicle module
