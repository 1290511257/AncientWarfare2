	C distributor needs separate output speeds per-output head, and network code to accomodate
	C fix gap in windmill model (and probably redo texture)
	* add 'clean' SS option to model editor
	* LOTS of instances of Tiles needing setDirty called when values are changed
	* workers idling when nearby enemies / enemies killed
	* clean up shield types -- remove the various material tiers, in lieu of a few cosmetic types of different sizes (buckler, mid, tower)
	* rework riding NPC mechanics 
		-- implement custom NPC model/rendering for when riding a horse
			--will require rendering of normal biped, in mounted stance
			--will additionally require rendering of the horse model
		-- despawn actual horse on NPC mount, start using mounted model and move speed
		-- will need to implement -much- of the horse logic into the NPC for use when it is mounted
			--perhaps use a delegate class to keep the intrusion into NpcBase as small as possible
