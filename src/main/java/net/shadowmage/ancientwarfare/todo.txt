	sterling/waterwheel/hand cranged engines
	warehouse storage med/large	
	recruiting station
	warehouse stock viewer
* Recipes
	-lots-
* Research

* Structure Module Plugins
	npcs?? (should be mostly handled?)
	town-hall block
* Sounds
	bard

****************************LICENSING TODO****************************
Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs
	add general license for mod
		
****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
* need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements in GUIs	
* GUI - SHIFT-CLICK CODE
	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
* alter structure scanner gui name-selection char validation
	--disallow invalid file-system chars (/?.'"<>[]{}!@#$%^&*()_+)
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the vanilla tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.  All AW stuff should already be using saving stacks with item-name
* Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice(er)

****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
^ lots of testing/validation on new warehouse system
^ finish up storage block filter-setting ability, verify that it works properly (needs the above step to view storage-block inventory contents)
* Torque API:
	Add input max/tick code to tiles, reset counter every tile-update.
	Add power-loss to blocks.  The amount lost should be proportional to the amount stored.  Something about
		drag from air resistance increasing with the speed of the object that is moving. Allow for higher-grade blocks to not lose power.			
	Add high-quality blocks with higher capacity and less/no power loss.
* add a 'warehouse stock viewer panel' --sign that can be slapped on the side of storage/input/output blocks to view the stock level of specified items (items specified via gui)
* fix up auto-crafting station -- it is losing its input-grid items on load/save of world
* finish removing old warehouse stuff (tiles/blocks/other code)
		
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
^ check that medic AI works and that 'flee to medic' ai works
^ check that 'flee hostiles' ai works as intended
^ verify that faction based mounted soldiers work as intended
^ verify functionality of mounted player-owned npcs (all)
* finish recruiting station block/tile/gui/container/code
* add recipes to copy upkeep/work/combat/routing orders
