Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs

core
	crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
	research system--needs definitions of research for research tree
	block and item textures (engineering station, research station, research book, research notes)
	Chunkloader blocks

GUIS (all modules)
	need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements	
	Finish creating proper text-input validation stuff for Text and NumberInput widgets
	SHIFT-CLICK CODE
	rendering of item stack quantities >99 -- need to do custom rendering of text, scaled down appropriately

TEXTURES
	automation
		warehouse input
		warehouse output
		warehouse storage small
		warehouse storage medium
		warehouse storage large
		warehouse crafting station
		flywheel
		hand-cranked-engine
	structure
		drafting station
		structure scanner
		structure builder
	
modeler
	who knows.... will need to start using it to find out what is broken / not working, will need it in vehicle module
	
structures module (done for now)
	plugins / support for other modules
	template plugin support for gates
	textures for drafting station, survival-mode builder block
	rework gates as a multi-block? (use controller TE TESR to render gate)
		at that point, can use blocks for collision and interaction
		probably less buggy than the entity-based interaction
		but how to handle only partially loaded gates?

automation module:
	GUIs Needed:
		
	Target select GUI is non-functional, and/or cannot remove targets			
	API / compat stuff:
		add IMC-based API to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??
		add config-based method to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??	
	warehouse needs to eject/limit item access when currentMaxStorage<currentStorage
		how to handle partially loaded warehouses, e.g. some of its storage blocks may be in unloaded chunks?
		--perhaps have different methods for tile.invalidate() and onBlockBroken
	warehouse output GUI -- swap filters from bottom to top, clone layout from storage block
	hand-cranked engine should output torque and/or buildcraft MJ
		--flywheel accepts MJ input				
	
npcs module
	worker will have 'work sites' list / work-order item, denoting which sites to work in what order/priority
		--possibility to use a user set priority list for workers
		--possibility to use a user set timetable for workers
		--possibility to use a user set route for workers
	npc types
		researcher (research)
		craftsman (builder)
		farmer (farms / animal farms)
		lumberjack (tree farms / builder)
		miner (quarries / builder)
		courier (item routing)
	TODO -- everything	
		
vehicles module
	everything
