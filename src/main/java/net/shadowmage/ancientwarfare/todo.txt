Licensing
	add bc license for using as libs

****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
	* crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
	* research system--needs definitions of research for research tree
	Implement tile-based rotatable block -- twenty-four way

GUIS (all modules)
	need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements	
	Finish creating proper text-input validation stuff for Text and NumberInput widgets
	SHIFT-CLICK CODE
	rendering of item stack quantities >99 -- need to do custom rendering of text, scaled down appropriately

****************************MEIM MODULE TODO****************************
who knows.... will need to start using it to find out what is broken / not working, will need it in vehicle module
	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
? rework gates as a multi-block? (use controller TE TESR to render gate)
	at that point, can use blocks for collision and interaction
	probably less buggy than the entity-based interaction
	but how to handle only partially loaded gates?	
* need to examine all plugins for places when item-stacks are saved to the tile/entity nbt -- need to handle these special and sideline the
	item-data to preserve the item-name rather than item-id.	
* recipes: (none?)
* Scanner GUI needs some cleanup / make it look nice
* plugins / support for vehicle module
* plugin support for automation module
* plugin support for npc module
	npcs--done
	blocks--
		town-hall
		structure-control block
* template plugin support for gates
* textures for drafting station, survival-mode builder block

****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
? worksites needed:
	Smeltery multiblock -- ore processing
		Smeltery control block (worksite)
		Smeltery heater/smelting block
		Smeltery input block
		Smeltery output block
	Lumberyard multiblock -- wood processing	
? Custom renders for power-states on power tiles?  Optional?
	would require a client-side config on whether to use custom render
	would also require a server-side config on whether to send the network data or not
	would need a change in block rendering for opacity/cutaway 
		and a TESR implemented for rendering of state
? API / compat stuff:
	add IMC-based API to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??
	add config-based method to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??	
* chunkloader blocks
* Add overlay rendering of work-site sizes while holding a work-site setting item.
* Change over worksite BB render to a TESR -- should be slightly more optimized
* Torque API:
	Add input max/tick code to tiles, reset counter every tile-update.
	Add power-loss to blocks.  The amount lost should be proportional to the amount stored.  Something about
		drag from air resistance increasing with the speed of the object that is moving. Allow for higher-grade blocks to not lose power.			
	Add high-quality blocks with higher capacity and less/no power loss.
* recipes
* warehouse output GUI -- swap filters from bottom to top, clone layout from storage block
* mailbox side-select GUI needs cleaned up to mirror worksite side-select GUI
* warehouse needs to eject/limit item access when currentMaxStorage<currentStorage
	how to handle partially loaded warehouses, e.g. some of its storage blocks may be in unloaded chunks?
	--perhaps have different methods for tile.invalidate() and onBlockBroken							

		
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
? all npcs should be capable of riding horses -- they use it purely for transportation speed increase
? add method to 'recruit' a factioned NPC that you are on high-standing with (converts to closest player-owned npc class?)	
? npc vendor type?
	player-owned npc that has a customizable trade list via GUI.
	owning players can setup the trades and give the npc their 'stock'
	owning players can withdraw the proceeds from bartering, and restock the vendor
	non-owning players can access the vendors trade screen to barter
? remove upkeep-orders, use internal block-position reference
? add auto-upkeep-point setting from town-hall broadcast
? add inventory to town-hall to use for upkeep
? add work broadcast to worksites for workers with no work-orders?
? add courier GUI that allows viewing of courier backpack inventory	
* add rendering of routes when npc-order item is being held
	work-order renders route + numbers
	routing-order renders route + sides
	combat-order renders patrol and guard points/targets
	find a way to render quads instead of gl-line, to enable depth-scaling of line width?
* combat bonuses for player-owned combat NPCs when in-range of a 'commander' set combat npc
* courier adjust functionality (speed) based on level
* add set/clear home point to npc GUI
* add repack button to npc GUI
* write all code for npc-item repack read/write
* worker needs to not work at night (if has home point set)
* player-owned priest AI
* player-owned trader AI
* player-owned bard AI
* find default sound/music for bards
* faction soldier AI
* faction leader AI
* faction archer AI
* faction priest AI
* faction trader AI
* fix skeletons / ranged mobs attack ai
	perhaps special case skeletons, loop through their AI to see how they are configured before adding either melee or ranged attack task (could just query skeleton-type)
* add faction structure control block
	for use by structure creators.
	respawns faction-based npcs and attempts to keep them within the bounds designated in the block
	controls only accessible to players in creative mode
* add recipes and research requirements for npcs and npc-related blocks
* add recipes to copy upkeep/work/combat/routing orders		
* add npc-recruiting station -- worksite, crafting
	has input slots for raw recruiting goods -- possibly just have input of player-owned raw npc-recruiting items to spawn/equip directly
	has X queue slots for queuing npcs for recruiting
	has X weapon/armor slots corresponding to queue slots
	when work is completed, spawns an NPC equipped with the items from the corresponding queue spots
	each input slot type has a different block-side to allow for automated item input
	allow for auto-queue of npc type
	-use is optional, players can always craft the raw npc items and equip manually	
* add town-hall block GUI
	tracks nearby entities.
	maintains list of dead-entity-data (they transmit to town-hall on death)
		this can be viewed by user
		? priests may occasionally use this to 'resurrect' a dead npc
	?can serve as a central upkeep-point for NPCs / designate a default 'safe' place
	can issue a 'call to arms' command to all nearby teamed npcs
		combat npcs will respond to the point in question 
		worker npcs will move to the town-hall for a certain period of time
	occasionally broadcast to all npcs in broadcast range (set from gui) to set town-hall point	
	
****************************VEHICLE MODULE TODO****************************
figure out collision detection for large rectangular entities
	examine collision detection for ender-dragon?
everything
