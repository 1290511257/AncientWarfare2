core (done for now)
	crafting system--needs recipes from other modules
	research system--needs definitions of research for research tree
	block and item textures (engineering station, research station, research book, research notes)

GUIS
	need LOTS of tooltips added to various elements

modeler
	who knows....
	
structures module (done for now)
	plugins / support for other modules
	textures for drafting station, survival-mode builder

automation module:
	API / compat stuff:
		add IMC-based API to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??
		add config-based method to add logs/saplings to forestry farm??	
		add plugin / support for power systems (mechanical worker block)(need APIs updated first)
	mechanical hopper block -- configurable pull / push side (s), and on/off push control
		with filter list per-side -- needs redstone power to function?
	optional input slot to run mechanical worker with coal -- disabled by default in config?	
	warehouse crafting station -- crafting station that auto-pulls stuff from warehouse
	waterwheel type engine / waterwheel worker
		
vehicles module
	everything

npcs module
	worker will have 'work sites' list / work-order item, denoting which sites to work in what order or priority
	everything
	
	
	
Warehouse Overview:
	Control Block
		Coordinates moving items between input and storage blocks
		GUI has two view modes -- by filter, and by item.
		Allows for requesting of items from storage to be moved into the control block.
			Requests may be process on a per-filter, or specific item basis
		
	Storage Blocks
		Storage for one or more items, defined by filters on a per-block basis.  Block only accepts items that match its filters.
		
	Input Blocks
		Work as default storage and a known place for warehouse control block to remove items that need sorting.
		Will also be used by control block to place items from storage blocks that no longer match the filters in that storage block.
		
Warehouse Functioning:
	Control Block
		Maintains a list of input and storage tiles.
		Maintains a map of what items may be placed into which storage block(s).
		Maintains a list of items that need sorted out of input blocks
		
	Storage Blocks
		Inform control block when filters change
		Inform control block when filtered-item-quantities change (client-side updates)
	
	Input Blocks		
		Inform control block when inventory is changed so that it may rescan for moveable items.
