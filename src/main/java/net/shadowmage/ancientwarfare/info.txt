	**************TEAMS**************
		All teams are derived from owning players team.
		If owning player is not on a team, or npc is not owned, they are considered NEUTRAL.  
		Neutral will not attack other teams, but will defend themselves vs attacks and attack 'bandits'. 
		Bandits / hostile NPCs will not be part of the team system and will have customized AI
		Combat npcs will attack other combat NPCS if the attacker has a team and the target has a team, and they are not the same team
	
	**************NPC INVENTORIES**************
	all npcs have full inventory accessibility for equipment slots
		main-hand slot determines work/combat type/inventory-size for couriers/bonus effectiveness for bards
		armor slots are used for actual armor
		upkeep slot is for upkeep orders -- where to get the food
		orders slot is for work/combat/route orders -- where to work / what to fight / what items to move	
	
	all npcs have an 'upkeep order' slot
		simple work-order that denotes a single point for npc upkeep.
		allows setting the amount of upkeep to withdraw
		allows setting the block-side to withdraw from (in the case of sided inventories)
	
	all npcs will have an 'orders' slot
		worker = work order, denotes what sites and in what order a workers should work
		courer = routing slip, denotes what sites and what items a courier should move
		combat = combat order, denotes a patro route for combat-based npcs.
			
	**************NPC UPKEEP**************
	Player owned NPCs may have their upkeep point set through the use of the 'Upkeep Orders' item
	Alternatively, if no upkeep item is present, an NPC will auto-assign an upkeep point to the
		nearest in range friendly town-hall.
	A player may use the command-baton to override this 'auto assigned upkeep point' to one of their choosing
		however while it does not require a upkeep-orders item ,using the command baton does not give the 
		option to set the amount of upkeep to withdraw or the side of the inventory to withdraw from.					

	**************NPC WORKERS**************
	Worker work points may be set via work-orders item.
	If no work-orders item is present, NPC will work at whatever nearby worksites 
		have work that are appropriate for his sub-type.			
	
	**************NPC LEVELING**************
	All npcs have a base (shared) level and experience value;
	Sub-typed npcs also store level and xp per sub-type.
		For npcs that can change subtypes (combat,worker), current level is looked up per-subtype;
		Each work/combat type will return a different level/experience value.
	When an NPC gains experience, it is applied to both his base-level/xp, as well as the sub-type level/xp
	Base level determines max hit-points.
	Sub-type level determines bonus damage or work-effectiveness.
	Npcs with no subtypes will have the same value for their base and (single) subtype level/xp values.		
		
	**************NPC HEALING**************		
	all npcs will 'heal' over time on their own, slowly
		player-owned NPCs will require upkeep be met in order to heal

	skin-packs should contain only minecraft skin-format .png files and a single skin-pack.meta file
	the skin-pack.meta file is should be specified with one entry per line, in the format of:
		npcType.npcSubType=image_name
		
		examples:
		worker=worker1.png
		worker=worker2.png
		worker.farmer=farmer1.png
		
	each npc type may be specified multiple times with separate images
	when multiple images are found for an npc, the npc will be assigned a random skin from those found for his type/subtype
	custom npc types may be specified in the skin-pack.meta file, these custom npc types may be referenced in the npc gui 'custom texture' field

	Each faction will have multiple NPC types:

			viking.archer = bow
			natives.archer = spear
			brigand.soldier = sword
