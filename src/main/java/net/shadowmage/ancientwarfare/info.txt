****************************NPC MODULE INFO****************************
	**************TOWN HALL**************
	Tracks nearby NPCs.
	NPCs report to the nearest in range (allied) town-hall block when they are killed.
		Player-owned priests use this dead-npc list to occasionally 'resurrect' a killed npc
		--must have an 'altar' block, or some-such?
	dead-npc list is saved in nbt, and clearable from player input.
	live entity list is only temporarily cached, rebuilt every X seconds to drop references and prevent memory leaks			  

	**************COMMAND BATON**************
		persistent list of entities commanded.
		stored in item-stack nbt as a list of UUIDs
		list is looked client side from item-nbt
		npcs must transmit UUID to client-side for lookup
		players may add to / remove from list by right-click of item while targeting a commandable NPC
		Commands -- move / guard / attack / attack area / set home / clear home / set upkeep / clear upkeep / clear command
		Client renders list of commanded npcs for baton while equipped
		Client renders under-cursor target while baton is equipped
		Has 5 hotkeys to control commands
			z-clear current command / openGUI (reg/sneak)
			x-attack / attack area (entity/block)
			c-move / guard (entity/block)
			v-set/clear home (reg/sneak)(may be removed)
			b-set/clear upkeep (reg/sneak)(may be removed)
		
	**************TEAMS**************
		All teams are derived from owning players team.
		If owning player is not on a team, or npc is not owned, they are considered NEUTRAL.  
		Neutral will not attack other teams, but will defend themselves vs attacks and attack 'bandits'. 
		Bandits / hostile NPCs will not be part of the team system and will have customized AI
		Combat npcs will attack other combat NPCS if the attacker has a team and the target has a team, and they are not the same team
	
	**************NPC INVENTORIES**************
	all npcs will have full inventory accessibility for equipment slots
		main-hand slot determines work/combat type
		armor slots are used for actual armor
		upkeep slot is for upkeep orders -- where to get the food
		orders slot is for work/combat/route orders -- where to work / what to fight / what items to move	
	
	all npcs will have an 'upkeep order' slot
		simple work-order that denotes a single point for npc upkeep.
		--perhaps have additional variables for the slip such as min / max to withdraw?
	
	all npcs will have an 'orders' slot
		worker = work order
		courer = routing slip
		combat = combat order		
		
		Work Order:
			3 settings - Priority, Timed, Route
			List of work-sites denotes what sites to work.  Setting type denotes when to go to the next worksite and what the next site will be.
		Routing Slip:
			Works pretty much like AW1
		Combat Order:
			Set custom team / player aggro controls
			Patrol path setting / guard setting
			Ability to customize the already config-customized aggro list.
	
	**************NPC LEVELING**************
	all npcs will have a 'level'
		they should gain experience towards this level with every successful action.
			actions:
				work
				attack
				route items
		how many levels?
		how big an effect should levels have on stats?
		
	**************NPC HEALING**************		
	all npcs will 'heal' over time on their own, slowly
		player-owned NPCs will require upkeep be met in order to heal
	
	**************NPC TYPES**************
	npc types
		worker
			worksite list set by item (orders slot)				
			work type set by primary equipped item type (weapon slot)
				miner=pickaxe
				lumberjack=axe
				farmer=hoe
				craftsman=hammer
				researcher=quill
			work capability set by equipped item quality for miner/lumberjack/farmer			 
			work capability adjusted by npc level for for miner/lumberjack/farmer
			work capability adjusted by npc level*2 for craftsman/researcher
			npc levels stored by work-type.
		courier 
			own npc type, has custom storage inventory, accepts routing slips instead of work-orders
			--backpack items for main inventory slot to determine inventory size (base 9 + bonus)?
			--actually displays/stores inventory in backpack item? --probably easier to not....
		combat
			combat type set by equipped item
				soldier=sword
				commander=special?
				archer=bow
				medic=special?
				combat engineer (repair)=hammer
				siege engineer (vehicle driver)=axe
			soldier damage determined by item equipped / item quality.
			soldier damage adjusted by npc 'level'
				keep level independently per attack type?
				
				
	**************NPC FACTIONS**************
	will have multiple factions:
		bandits
		pirates
		vikings
		jungle natives
		desert natives
	will have two tiers of npcs:
		normal -- use base faction number for if should attack
		elite guard -- use a higher number for if should attack -- have to have really good standing to be 'neutral' with them
	Each faction will have multiple NPC types:
		soldier / elite soldier
		archer / elite archer
		trader
		priest/medic (combo)
		commander / leader (elite version)
	Npc faction sub-types will have specific equipment, non-player configurable, set at spawn time, that vary by
		faction.  Cosmetic only.  Such as:
			pirate.archer = musket
			brigand.archer = crossbow
			viking.archer = bow
			natives.archer = spear
			brigand.soldier = sword
			pirate.soldier = cutlass
	Each 'faction' will have its own NPC base-class -- so players can i.e. specify npcs to be hostile vs brigands but not pirates.
