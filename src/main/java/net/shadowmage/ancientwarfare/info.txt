****************************NPC MODULE INFO****************************
	**************TOWN HALL**************
	Tracks nearby NPCs.
	NPCs report to the nearest in range (allied) town-hall block when they are killed.
		Player-owned priests use this dead-npc list to occasionally 'resurrect' a killed npc
		--must have an 'altar' block, or some-such?
	dead-npc list is saved in nbt, and clearable from player input.
	live entity list is only temporarily cached, rebuilt every X seconds to drop references and prevent memory leaks			  

	**************COMMAND BATON**************
		persistent list of entities commanded.
		stored in item-stack nbt as a list of UUIDs
		list is looked client side from item-nbt
		npcs must transmit UUID to client-side for lookup
		players may add to / remove from list by right-click of item while targeting a commandable NPC
		Commands -- move / guard / attack / attack area / set home / clear home / set upkeep / clear upkeep / clear command
		Client renders list of commanded npcs for baton while equipped
		Client renders under-cursor target while baton is equipped
		Has 5 hotkeys to control commands
			z-clear current command / openGUI (reg/sneak)
			x-attack / attack area (entity/block)
			c-move / guard (entity/block)
			v-set/clear home (reg/sneak)(may be removed)
			b-set/clear upkeep (reg/sneak)(may be removed)
		
	**************TEAMS**************
		All teams are derived from owning players team.
		If owning player is not on a team, or npc is not owned, they are considered NEUTRAL.  
		Neutral will not attack other teams, but will defend themselves vs attacks and attack 'bandits'. 
		Bandits / hostile NPCs will not be part of the team system and will have customized AI
		Combat npcs will attack other combat NPCS if the attacker has a team and the target has a team, and they are not the same team
	
	**************NPC INVENTORIES**************
	all npcs will have full inventory accessibility for equipment slots
		main-hand slot determines work/combat type/inventory-size for couriers/bonus effectiveness for bards
		armor slots are used for actual armor
		upkeep slot is for upkeep orders -- where to get the food
		orders slot is for work/combat/route orders -- where to work / what to fight / what items to move	
	
	all npcs will have an 'upkeep order' slot
		simple work-order that denotes a single point for npc upkeep.
		allows setting the amount of upkeep to withdraw
		allows setting the block-side to withdraw from (in the case of sided inventories)
	
	all npcs will have an 'orders' slot
		worker = work order, denotes what sites and in what order a workers should work
		courer = routing slip, denotes what sites and what items a courier should move
		combat = combat order, denotes a patro route for combat-based npcs.
			
	**************NPC UPKEEP**************
	Player owned NPCs may have their upkeep point set through the use of the 'Upkeep Orders' item
	Alternatively, if no upkeep item is present, an NPC will auto-assign an upkeep point to the
		nearest in range friendly town-hall.
	A player may use the command-baton to override this 'auto assigned upkeep point' to one of their choosing
		however while it does not require a upkeep-orders item ,using the command baton does not give the 
		option to set the amount of upkeep to withdraw or the side of the inventory to withdraw from.					

	**************NPC WORKERS**************
	Worker work points may be set via work-orders item.
	If no work-orders item is present, NPC will work at whatever nearby worksites 
		have work that are appropriate for his sub-type.			
	
	**************NPC LEVELING**************
	All npcs have a base (shared) level and experience value;
	Sub-typed npcs also store level and xp per sub-type.
		For npcs that can change subtypes (combat,worker), current level is looked up per-subtype;
		Each work/combat type will return a different level/experience value.
	When an NPC gains experience, it is applied to both his base-level/xp, as well as the sub-type level/xp
	Base level determines max hit-points.
	Sub-type level determines bonus damage or work-effectiveness.
	Npcs with no subtypes will have the same value for their base and (single) subtype level/xp values.		
		
	**************NPC HEALING**************		
	all npcs will 'heal' over time on their own, slowly
		player-owned NPCs will require upkeep be met in order to heal
	
	**************NPC TYPES**************

				soldier=sword
				commander=special?
				archer=bow
				medic=special?

	**************NPC FACTIONS**************
	will have multiple factions:
		bandits
		pirates
		vikings
		jungle natives
		desert natives
	will have two tiers of npcs:
		normal -- use base faction number for if should attack
		elite guard -- use a higher number for if should attack -- have to have really good standing to be 'neutral' with them
	Each faction will have multiple NPC types:
		soldier / elite soldier
		archer / elite archer
		trader
		priest/medic (combo)
		commander / leader (elite version)
	Npc faction sub-types will have specific equipment, non-player configurable, set at spawn time, that vary by
		faction.  Cosmetic only.  Such as:
			pirate.archer = musket
			brigand.archer = crossbow
			viking.archer = bow
			natives.archer = spear
			brigand.soldier = sword
			pirate.soldier = cutlass
	Each 'faction' will have its own NPC base-class -- so players can i.e. specify npcs to be hostile vs brigands but not pirates.
