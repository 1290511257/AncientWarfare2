vehicles todo:

* vehicle start:
	Movement handling -- need to implement acceleration stuff (incl. gravity)
	** Collision detection
	Turret functionality for the basic siege engines
	Models / textures

* vehicle types:
	Land:
		Catapult (single pilot)
		Ballista (single pilot) (large)
		Scorpio (small metal spring-type ballista) (sized like the old ballistas)		
			-non-mobile, ballista slightly smaller, no turret, yaw locked to vehicle
		Trebuchet (single pilot)
			-non-mobile, no turret, yaw locked to vehicle
		Cannon (single pilot)
		Hwacha (single pilot)
		Battering Ram (single pilot)
		Chest Cart (single pilot)
		Siege Tower (multi-passenger)(need to find a way to 'extend' the tower, and a way for players to 'climb' the tower / get off at the right position (hit 'fire' once climbed appropriately?))			
	 Water: (might need to reduce gun counts for easier managing of stuff...)
		Sloop/Pinnace - small multi-passenger, 8 gun max
		Frigate - med multi-passenger, 25 gun max	
		Galleon - large multi-passenger, 50 gun max
	Air:
		Hot Air Balloon
			-burns coal / fuel materials
			-will lose altitude slowly when fuel runs out
		Ornithopter
			-not really a vehicle per-se, more of a jetpack / wearable armor
			- flap to fly, hold flap to glide
		Airship (a small-ish frigate with an elongated hot air balloon above it...)
			-burns coal / fuel materials
			-will be immobile (except for descend command) when out of fuel	


Needed to get normal vehicles working:
- Aim synching
	- do they have turrets or aim with vehicle yaw?
	- what happens if yaw is not lined up for shot? (obv. it misses...)
	- turrets make most vehicles easier to aim (unless vehicle rotation is made to rotate in smaller increments)
- models / textures
- missile types / models / textures
- multi-part BBs
- can vehicles mobile, or are they static?
	- makes sense for most vehicles:
		catapult
		cannon
		hwacha
		ballista
		battering ram
		siege tower
		chest cart
	- trebuchet is immobile
	-- perhaps allow them to be mobile, but move slowly and unpilotable by NPCs? (e.g. player-only)
		- engineers assigned a vehicle will 'construct' their vehicle at a given site, and repack/deconstruct it when it is time to move
		- how does this work with a siege tower, chest-cart, battering ram?
			-...it doesn't...
	-- simplifies things greatly if none of the vehicles are mobile
		-except how to handle chest-cart, battering ram, and siege tower?
	-- allow vehicles to be mobile, but enable NPCs with only a basic 'driving' AI rather than full-blown pathfinding
		- solves issues with chest-carts, battering ram, siege-towers
		- still does not answer how to handle yaw-aim adjustment
			-by vehicle yaw
			-or by turret on vehicle
			
Proposed:
- Vehicles do not have turrets.  Vehicle yaw = aim yaw.
- Auto-aim only handles pitch/power adjustment
	- Most vehicles are mobile (all but trebuchet?)
	- Ballista comes in mobile (ballista) and fixed-stand versions (scorpio)
- NPCs only have a basic 'drive vehicle' AI and ZERO pathfinding for when riding
	- NPCs will 'cheat' when it comes time to aiming, and just -set- the vehicle rotation to what they need for a chosen shot
