vehicles todo

* collision handling
	- need to figure out how to handle overriding MCs AABB stuff
* multi passenger vehicles



* client-side prediction for movement
	- shouldn't be too hard, cyclic buffer, command ID, synch position and input status at each tick
		- perhaps only full synch every X ticks
		- only send input state changes along with the time/tick/commandID for that tick
			-- how to handle inbetween ticks / network jitter?
			
input handling:
	- callback from keybind handler, or poll state?
		-probably poll state for movement-related stuff, or use a reset flag to tell if it was pressed at all during that tick
