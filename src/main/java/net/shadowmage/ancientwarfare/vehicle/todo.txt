vehicles todo

* collision handling
	- need to figure out how to handle overriding MCs AABB stuff
* multi passenger vehicles
* vehicles that you can walk around on
	- rotate position of entity relative to vehicle rotation, test for rectangular BB to determine if the entity should fall off or not?
	- when vehicle rotates all on-top entities will need to be rotated around for their relative position
	- will use input interception to facilitate movement of player on vehicle
	- will use some sort of fake 'world' for collision detection.  Perhaps just a list of AABBs for the vehicle interior with manual resolution
* vehicle tier/upgrade system
	- do not have material teirs, just use upgrades for enhanced functionality
	- use click-to-apply upgrades, or slotted?
		one way allows for -all- upgrades to be applied, the other limits to a selected range by player choice
