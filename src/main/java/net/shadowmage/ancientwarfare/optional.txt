****************************CORE MODULE TODO****************************
? Implement tile-based rotatable block -- twenty-four way
? find a method to make a 'treasure' system:
	this would be a map or 'notes' item that a player can find in a dungeon or structures
	this should lead them to another dungeon that contains good treasure

****************************AUTOMATION MODULE TODO****************************	
? worksites needed:
	Smeltery multiblock -- ore processing
		Smeltery control block (worksite)
		Smeltery heater/smelting block
		Smeltery input block
		Smeltery output block
	Lumberyard multiblock -- wood processing	
? Custom renders for power-states on power tiles?  Optional?
	would require a client-side config on whether to use custom render
	would also require a server-side config on whether to send the network data or not
	would need a change in block rendering for opacity/cutaway 
		and a TESR implemented for rendering of state
	would need to design model and model-renderer for it
	would need textures	
			
****************************NPC MODULE TODO****************************
? add method to 'recruit' a factioned NPC that you are on high-standing with (converts to closest player-owned npc class?)	
? npc vendor type?
	player-owned npc that has a customizable trade list via GUI.
	owning players can setup the trades and give the npc their 'stock'
	owning players can withdraw the proceeds from bartering, and restock the vendor
	non-owning players can access the vendors trade screen to barter
? add faction structure control block
	for use by structure creators.
	respawns faction-based npcs and attempts to keep them within the bounds designated in the block
	controls only accessible to players in creative mode
	
****************************STRUCTURE MODULE TODO****************************
? rework gates as a multi-block? (use controller TE TESR to render gate)
	at that point, can use blocks for collision and interaction
	probably less buggy than the entity-based interaction
	but how to handle only partially loaded gates?
