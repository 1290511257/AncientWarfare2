Quarry:
	Initial Bounds should encompass the top layer of blocks to be quarried.
		Bounds will be reconfigured on input to include down to y=0;
	Scanning should be done as:
		keep ref to current position.
		when work is done:
			while nextblock==null
				nextblock = incrementPosition, check block;
		initial position will need to be set when the civic is first built.
			(as status is stored in NBT, should only need called from the builder-item)
		when scanning for next position, will search top-down at the x,y of the position
			to make sure there are no interfering blocks placed _above_ the mining area.
			max Y checked will be the max bounds of the civic.
		only maintains a single block-position for the 'next' work tick.  should validate that
			the block needs removed before processing work -- if it is not valid, it should find the next
			block if available, or process as finished.	

Tree farm:
	Bounds set as-per normal.
	Planting blocks need to be set via GUI
	Will use the tree-walk path-finding method to find all tree blocks attached to a given base block.
	Uses worker triggered area rescan
	
Crops Farm:	
	Bounds set as-per normal.
	Planting blocks need to be set via GUI
	Uses worker triggered area rescan
	
Mushroom Farm:
	Bounds set as-per normal.
	Planting blocks need to be set via GUI
	Uses worker triggered area rescan

Cactus/Reed farm:
	Bounds set as-per normal.  
	Will scan up from the bottom.  
	Only the bottom block needs be within work bounds.
	
Fish/Squid farm:
	Bounds should encompass top-layer of water.  
	Counts water blocks from surface downward.  
	Max catch % is capped (beyond X water blocks, more does not help)
		^^ still gives higher bonuses for 'ocean' type setups than
		the previous fish-farms.		

All GUIs:
	Need inventory area for input/access.
	Main page should also have buttons to swap access-sides for inventories.

Farm GUIs:
	Will need additional page to configure planting blocks.
