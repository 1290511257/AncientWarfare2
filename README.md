===============

In order to develop on this project you will need to:  

1) Download the repository into a local folder.  

2) Locate this folder, run `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew`.

This should download all dependencies and setup proper `.classpath`. Import the project into Eclipse from the downloaded folder/repository.  
At this point it should be completely setup to begin development.  
  
This is a rewrite of Ancient Warfare mod for Minecraft for Minecraft versions 1.12.x+.

 
Modules initially available will be:

* Core (mandatory for all sub-modules)  

* Automation -- adds quarries, automated farms, tree-farms, etc.
