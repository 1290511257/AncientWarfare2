AncientWarfare2
===============
In order to develop on this project you will need to:  
Download the repository into a local folder.  
Locate this folder, run gradle_update.bat  
This should download all dependencies and setup proper .classpath  
Import the project into eclipse from the downloaded folder/repository.  
At this point it should be completely setup to begin development.  
  
This is a rewrite of Ancient Warfare mod for Minecraft for Minecraft versions 1.7.x +  
This will be a (near) complete rewrite.  Some features may not translate directly from older versions and no guarantee
of compatibility between older versions will be made -- in fact, it is guaranteed that older versions (1.x.x) will NOT
be compatible with version 2.x releases.
